Hello there, welcome to my website! I work as a senior machine learning research scientist at [Layer 6 AI](https://layer6.ai/) in Toronto, where I split my time performing fundamental AI research, as well as building and deploying machine learning models. I hold a PhD in [Statistics from Columbia University](http://stat.columbia.edu/), and a BSc in Applied Mathematics from [ITAM](https://www.itam.mx/en) in Mexico City.

My research focuses on deep learning, generative models, probabilistic methods, and manifold learning. I aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice by developing principled methods that are actually useful in the real world. Some highlights of my research include:
1. <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">Studying the interplay between deep generative models and the manifold hypothesis. Among other benefits, viewing generative models through this lens: </span>
 - <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Reveals that as commonly used, [maximum-likelihood lacks statistical consistency](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.07172).</span>
 - <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Elucidates [why some generative models work better than others](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02954).</span>
 - <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Explains [why models sometimes assign higher likelihoods to out-of-distribution data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18910) than they do to training data, while also allowing to circumvent this problem for outlier detection.</span>
 - <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Allows to [detect and alleviate memorization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00113) in generative models.</span>
2. <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">Showing that FID — the most popular metric for evaluating generative models of images — does not correlate with human assessments of realism, and that replacing the Inception network used to compute FID with DINOv2 [addresses the issue](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04675).</span>
3. <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">Inventing a new exponential family of distributions, with both the [univariate](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/f82798ec8909d23e55679ee26bb26437-Abstract.html) and [multivariate](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08563) versions having practical applications in deep learning.</span>
